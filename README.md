![](https://github.com/itsmearafik/Data_Visualization-TaTa-/blob/main/dashboard.png)
An online retail store wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.


## Objectives
1. Analyze what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so the senior management can strategically plan for next year.
2. Analyze sales data to provide clear operational and marketing performance metrics.
3. Identify high-performing regions to guide business expansion and focus on successful areas.
4. Break down key sales metrics by available demographics (e.g., country) for deeper customer insights.

## Tools and Methodology
**Power BI**: For dashboard creation and data visualization.

**DAX**: Created calculated columns to extract year, quarter, month and day from the "invoice date" column. Also created a measure to calculate the "total revenue".

**Power Query**: Performed data cleaning, preparation and transformation to ensure error free analysis.

## Questions relevant to the senior management demands
**Questions of interest to the CEO**
1. Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest?
2. What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?
3. Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?
4. Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?

**Questions of interest to the CMO**
1. What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?
2. For the repeat customers, how long does it take for them to place the next order after being delivered the previous one?
3. What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?
4. Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?

## Key Insights from the Analysis (The Data Visuals)
1. The Sales by Month visual shows that there are some months of the year where exceptional growth is witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December, therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year.
   
2. The Sales by Country visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand instead we are more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated.

3. The Sales by Customer visual shows the top 10 customers who have purchased the most from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17%
more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.

4. The map visual shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.

## Recommendations for each insight
1. To make the most of the high potential revenue opportunity for subsequent years, the company should launch early seasonal marketing campaigns by August, secure inventory in advance, and introduce special offers or bundles to capture higher demand and maximize sales during the peak months.

2. The company should increase localized marketing, run country-specific promotions, and consider local partnerships to strengthen its presence and unlock more market share in the promising regions.

3. The company should roll out loyalty rewards or VIP perks to retain these high-value customers, find upselling opportunities based on their buying patterns, and maintain excellent service to encourage repeat purchases and referrals.

4. The company should make extensive research the low revenue generating regions to understand demand, test targeted online campaigns, adapt product offerings if needed, and gradually invest in new markets to boost global reach and revenue.
